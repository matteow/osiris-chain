# monitoring/ - Monitoring Configurations

This directory contains configuration files and related assets for monitoring the Osiris blockchain node. It primarily integrates with Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization.

## Key Files:

- `prometheus.yml`: The main configuration file for Prometheus, defining targets to scrape metrics from (e.g., the Osiris node's metrics endpoint) and rules for alerts.
- `grafana/`: This subdirectory typically contains Grafana dashboards (e.g., JSON files) that can be imported into a Grafana instance to visualize the metrics collected by Prometheus.

## Advanced Documentation:

### Prometheus Configuration (`prometheus.yml`)

- **Scrape Configurations:** Details how Prometheus is configured to discover and scrape metrics from Osiris nodes. Explains `job_name`, `static_configs`, and `targets`.
- **Alerting Rules:** Describes any predefined alerting rules within Prometheus, which trigger notifications based on specific metric thresholds or patterns.
- **Service Discovery:** If dynamic service discovery is used, explains the mechanisms (e.g., file-based, Kubernetes-based) for Prometheus to automatically find Osiris nodes.

### Grafana Dashboards (`grafana/`)

- **Dashboard Structure:** Explains the structure of the Grafana dashboard JSON files, including panels, queries, and variables.
- **Key Metrics Visualized:** Lists the most important metrics visualized in the dashboards (e.g., transaction throughput, block height, CPU/memory usage, network latency).
- **Customization:** Provides guidance on how to customize existing dashboards or create new ones to suit specific monitoring needs.

### Monitoring Best Practices

- **Deployment:** Recommendations for deploying Prometheus and Grafana alongside Osiris nodes.
- **Alerting Strategies:** Best practices for setting up effective alerts to ensure timely detection of operational issues.
- **Performance Analysis:** How to use the collected metrics to analyze the performance and health of the Osiris network.
